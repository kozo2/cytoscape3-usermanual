What are apps?
--------------

Cytoscape's capabilities are not fixed. They can be expanded with
**apps**. They can extend Cytoscape in a variety of ways. One app can
have the ability to import data from an online database. Another app
could provide a new method for analyzing networks. You can install apps
after you have installed Cytoscape. Most apps were made by Cytoscape
users like you.

If you're familiar with Cytoscape 2.x, you probably know that Cytoscape
apps were called **plugins**. Starting in Cytoscape 3.0, we are calling
them **apps**. Cytoscape 2.x plugins cannot be used in Cytoscape 3.0.

Installing Apps
---------------

You can install apps through [the App Store](http://apps.cytoscape.org)
or within Cytoscape. In this section, we'll talk about installing apps
through Cytoscape. You can learn how to install apps through the App
Store [here](http://apps3.nrnb.org/help/getstarted_app_install).

To install apps within Cytoscape, go to the menu bar and choose **Apps â†’
App Manager**. At the top of the **App Manager** window, make sure you
have the **Install** tab selected.

There are three ways you can find apps:

-   If you know the name of an app you're looking for, enter it in the
    **Search** field. The App Manager will list the apps whose names or
    descriptions match the **Search** field in the middle panel.

-   If you have a general idea of what sort of app you're looking for,
    double-click on the **apps by tag** folder, then click on one of the
    tags that interests you. The apps with that tag are listed in the
    middle panel.

-   If you're not sure what sort of app you and want to see everything,
    click the **all apps** folder. In the middle pane, you will see a
    list of all the apps.

When you click on an app in the middle panel, the App Manager shows its
short description and icon in the right panel. If you want more
information about the app, click the **View on App Store** button on the
bottom-right. If you want to go ahead and install the app, click the
**Install** button.

If you've downloaded an app to your computer, you can install it by
clicking the **Install from File** button on the bottom-left.

Managing your Installed Apps
----------------------------

You can see a list of all apps you have installed by clicking the
**Currently Installed** tab at the top. When you click on an app in the
list, you'll see a description of your app at the bottom. At the bottom,
you'll see a couple buttons where you can:

-   **Uninstall** an app. This deletes the app from your computer. If
    you want to reinstall the app, you will have to find it again in the
    **Install from App Store** tab or in the App Store site and
    reinstall it there.

-   **Disable** an app. This temporarily disables the app. The app stays
    on your computer, but Cytoscape does not load it. You can enable the
    app by first selecting the disabled app in the list, then click
    **Enable**.
