Introduction
============

Cytoscape @version@ is the latest version of Cytoscape, building upon
the new architecture, developer API and set of user controls established
in the 3.x series. If you're familiar with former versions of Cytoscape,
this version will feel completely familiar and you'll be all set to go.
In future releases, we will continue to tweak and improve both the
software and the documentation. This manual will be updated to reflect
all the latest changes.

*This manual describes the installation and use of Cytoscape. For a more
thorough understanding of Cytoscape and its ecosystem, we highly
recommend reading the **Welcome Letter** accessible on the
http://cytoscape.org website.
