[Cytoscape Privacy Policy](http://wiki.cytoscape.org/Cytoscape_3/UserManual/Cytoscape_3/UserManual/Privacy)
===========================================================================================================

We respect the privacy of all Cytoscape users, and we do not collect any
information on Cytoscape users except in the situations listed below. In
no case do we attempt to tie any of this information back to a user, nor
do we give, share, sell, or transfer this information to any third party
unless required by law. We use this information only in the aggregate to
generate statistics to assist in securing continued funding for
Cytoscape.

-   On the Cytoscape download web page, we log the date, time, browser
    signature, and IP address to which we deliver Cytoscape.

-   For a news feed fetched for display on the Cytoscape Welcome screen,
    we log the date and time the news was fetched, the browser
    signature, and the IP address for the workstation running Cytoscape.

This policy may change from time to time, and if it does, we will notify
you via the Cytoscape Welcome screen news feed and via our normal mass
notification media. We will also update this section of the user manual.

Note that some internal Cytoscape Apps and Apps available through the
Cytoscape App Store connect with third party services via the Internet.
Once an App links to such a service, you are subject to the privacy
policy of that service.
